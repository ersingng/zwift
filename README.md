# Guideline 
- Clone repository
- navigate to project directory
- run 'npm install' on terminal to install all dependencies
- install cucumber through extensions tab (if you are using vs code), or another cherking tool
- run 'npx codeceptjs run --steps' to execute all the steps
- if you want to see all the details of steps, basically add --verbose to above command
